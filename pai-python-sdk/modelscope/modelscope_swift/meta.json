      "Description": "ModelScope Swift is an efficient fine-tuning training and inference framework developed by the ModelScope community. With just a few lines of code, developers can fine-tune and deploy large language models. In the current document, we will use the Qwen-7B-Chat model as an example to demonstrate how to perform fine-tuning training and model deployment on the PAI platform using the ModelScope Swift through the PAI Python SDK."
